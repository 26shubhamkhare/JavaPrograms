/*While the code works, it's not as efficient as using a HashSet or List, especially for long sentences, because checking for duplicates involves a string search, which could lead to a higher time complexity (approximately O(n^2) in the worst case).
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Example Scenario:
Letâ€™s assume result = "day at Amazon " and the word being checked is "day".

result.contains(" day "): This will check for " day " in the middle of the string and return true because "day" is present in the sentence.
result.startsWith("day" + " "): This will check if the string starts with "day " (since "day" is the first word), and return true.
result.endsWith(" " + word): This will check if the string ends with " day".
Each check is tailored to cover different cases (start, middle, or end), ensuring that words are only added once, no matter where they appear.
