/*Explanation:
Convert to lowercase: The string is converted to lowercase to handle case-insensitive comparison.
Split the string: The string is split into words using spaces as the delimiter.
Nested loops: The outer loop iterates over each word, and the inner loop counts how many times that word appears in the array.
Avoid duplicate counting: Before counting a word, we ensure that it hasnâ€™t already been counted. */
